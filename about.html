    <h1>Welcome to SAIKA studios!</h1>
<div type="container">
    <p>My name is Anya Laudenslager, and I am what you would call a "Jack-of-all-trades".
        Though I am primarily an artist by heart, I have training in web-development (specializing
        in front-end development), visual-merchandising, fashion styling, graphic design, 
        illustration, jewelry design/assembly, metal-smithing and have assisted in prep work and menu 
        coordination with a local sushi chef. I am a fast learner and can adapt to almost any situation.
        If there's any project in need of some design tweaks and flair, contact me!</p>
